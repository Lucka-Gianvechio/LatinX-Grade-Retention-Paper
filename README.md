## Summary


In this project we used a rich dataset of the school system in Sertãozinho (in the countryside of the state of São Paulo - Brazil). We have data for a cohort of about 2000 students gathered in 2012 and 2017, being able to tell which students repeated at least one grade between these years. To predict which students didn't progress all five years between 2012 and 2017, it was used information collected in 2012 such as: Parents' education, personality traits, grades, poverty indicators and others. Our main goal is to understand the predictive power of personality traits. For that, we analysed using 3 different group of features: (i) Only personality traits, (ii) All features excluding personality traits, and (iii) All features. Besides comparing the analysis done in each feature group, we used tools for explaining our black box classifiers.

Barplots of average cross-validation AUCs (±std. error) with K= 10. We combined three sets of features (Personalities only,  Others Only and All features) and two models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost Classifier).  The red line displays the maximum average ROC AUC score achieved.


  ## Description of notebooks
  
   - CrossValidation
   
      Here we run our Logistic regression and XGBoost models, and compare their performances.
   
   - DataDescription
   
      In this notebook we describe basic informations about each variable, such as: Variable name, variable description, whether the variable is discrete or continuous, if the variable is continuous, the components that describe it (min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max, mean, number of terms), if the variable is discrete, we list its factors, we show the percentage of NAs, and we present histograms of the variables' factors when appropriate.

   - DataSummarization

      In this notebook we run correlation tests between variables, show heatmaps, boxplots, apply dimentional reduction, MDS plot, linear discrimination analysis and Supervisoned Variational Relevance Learning (SUVREL).
 
   - EditingDataset

      In this notebook we execute some data cleaning and preparation. We created the variable 'semester', added the variable 'delay' and 'delay years' as dummy variables, converted variables that had factors as text into dummy variables when appropriate, and performed data processing techiniques to make numerical variables have average = 0 and standard deviation = 1.









## Description of variables

In the article we define three distinct feature groups: Personality traits, Non personality traits (which in the paper is also referred as "Other features" or "Others only") and All features (Personality traits and Non personality traits combined).

   - month, year, semester
    
        Description: Month: Month of the student's birth. Inputs range from 1 to 12, indicating each month of the year.
